# 1. IMDB Movie Visualization

In this project, data was for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. 

I have used visualization techniques to derive various insights from the data:
-  Highest rated movies which have been liked by critics and audiences alike.
-  Most Popular Trios
-  Demographic Analysis

#2. Risk Analytics in Banking and Financial Services using EDA

The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter.
This analysis aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
